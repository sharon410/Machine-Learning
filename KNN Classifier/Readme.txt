Dataset used is University of California, Riversideâ€™s Time Series Classification Dataset Repository.
First, Dataset Imputation with KNN - To replace the missing value in a column by an average of its K-Nearest Neighbors where K acts as a hyperparameter.
Then, Time Series Classification with Various Distance Measures- Experiment with various distance measures provided with the scipy library.
Finally, Accelerating K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier is done using the following two speedup strategies
1. Partial Distances/Lower Bounding
2. Locality Sensitive Hashing
