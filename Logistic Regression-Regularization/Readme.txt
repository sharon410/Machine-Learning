Dataset used is Bank Dataset
Here I have implemented a Backward search for variable selection.
Then Regularization for Logistic Regression is done. Grid search with k-fold cross-validation is used for model selection i.e. choosing best hyperparameters.
Implementing Hyperband for Logistic Regression - Here implementation of a state-of-the-art Hyperparameter Optimization algorithm for tuning the hyperparameters is carried out.
